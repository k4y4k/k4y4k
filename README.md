Hey 👋 I'm a front-end developer from Australia who's 80% Vegemite, 40% caffeine, 10% noodles, and _really bad at math_ 😂

Here's some things about me:

- 🔭 I'm currently working on **[The Complex Compendium](https://github.com/k4y4k/bookish-fiesta)**, a website for my close friend about her stories. (I'm a code person, she's an art person... what more do I need to say?).
- 🌱 I'm currently learning **[three.js]() and [theatre]()**. I've always been a big fan of motion graphics, so being able to do them on the web is super exciting!
- 💬 Ask me about **Linux, federated services (❤️ big fan of Mastodon and writefreely), and [what I'm doing to my install of VS Code](https://twitter.com/mynameis_kayak/status/1390575740349865986?s=20).**
- ⚡ Fun facts: My favourite TV show is **BoJack Horseman**, my favourite video game is **Xenoblade Chronicles**, and my favourite album is **[The End Has Begun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xJjRUeKWC0) by 3**.
- 😌 is my favourite emoji.
